# Identify the Snake Breed

```
Problem statement
The government has been facing a long-standing issue of wild animals entering residential areas due to various reasons. It's of critical importance that if any such dangerous animal is encountered, the concerned authority should be notified immediately. Reptiles, especially snakes, are among the most dangerous animals and they often enter residential areas. 

Recently due to an incident of a youngster getting bitten by a snake, the government decided to install cameras at every corner of the road to detect snakes and other animals.

You have been hired as a Deep Learning engineer to create a sophisticated model that can detect the breed of a snake from its image.
